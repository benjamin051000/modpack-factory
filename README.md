# Modpack Factory üè≠
This project is a command-line minecraft modpack creation tool.

Its primary purpose is to help you find a working configuration of the mods you supply 
by determining the proper versions of each mod, minecraft, and even selecting the loader.

Under the hood, this tool uses a SAT solver to determine what you need to build your modpack.

Modpack Factory is inspired by cargo and uv for dependency management.

## Features
- Creates mcproject.toml, which tracks your modpack's mods
- Uses SAT solving to determine versions of Minecraft, loader, and mods, given a list of mods
